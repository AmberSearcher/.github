# Amber Search

Amber Search is a search engine that aims to be more transparent and community-driven than traditional search engines. Our goal is to make it easier for people to find what they are looking for, while also respecting their privacy.

## How does it work?

Amber Search is a custom search engine that uses a combination of web scraping and search algorithms to find relevant results. It is built using the Go programming language for the scraping, C++ for the backend, and TS/Vue for the frontend.

The search engine is designed to be as transparent as possible, with all of the source code available on GitHub. We also have a list of all of the sites that we have crawled, which is available on the GitHub page.

## How can I help?

We are always looking for more people to help us with the search engine. If you have any suggestions or feedback, feel free to open an issue on GitHub. We are also looking for people to help us with crawling and indexing new sites.

If you want to get involved, you can start by forking the repository and making changes. We are also happy to accept pull requests.

## What is the future of Amber Search?

We hope to continue to improve the search engine and make it more useful for people. We are also considering adding more features, such as the ability to search for specific types of content (such as images or videos).

<!-- We are also considering creating a community-driven search engine, where users can submit their own search results and vote on the relevance of other people's results. -->

Enjoy searching!
